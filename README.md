# libosxnotify

No nonsense OS X notifications for scripts.

## What?

This repostory contains some Objective-C code that can be used by external
programs to display native OS X notifications.

## Why?

It all started as an idea to practice writing Python extensions in C. Then
[@lukaszkorecki](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki) suggested to support FFI
so this code can be used in languages other than Python. The idea was to allow
scripts to display notifications without relying on calling third party
binaries.

In time, the idea evolved to become a shared library which can be used by other
programs (e.g. the supplied `osxnotify` program) that want to display
notifications.

## Requirements

* OS X >= 10.9.4 - should work on Mountain Lion but it's not tested.
* Xcode and command line utilities.

## Installation

There are two ways to install libosxnotify - from a Homebrew tap or from
source.

### From Homebrew tap

To install the library from the Homebrew tap, issue the following commands:

```sh
$ brew tap tomekwojcik/tomekwojcik
$ brew install libosxnotify
```

### From source

To install the library from source, clone the repository and issue the
following commands:

```sh
$ ./configure
$ make install
```

By default, the library will install to `/usr/local`. You can change this using
`--prefix` parameter for `configure`, e.g. 

```sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/Users/bilbo/opt/libosxnotify
$ make install
```

## Usage

See the code of `osxnotify` program for usage example.

## Issues and limitations

Due to the nature of OS X notification system, it's currently impossible to
change the icon. OS X assumes that notifications are sent from a running app.
Since this isn't the case in, say, Python scripts, libosxnotify has to hack
Objective-C runtime to make it think there's an app running. By doing so,
libosxnotify sets the ID of the current up to the system-provided Terminal.app.

libosxnotify only supports text content (title, subtitle and informative text)
in notifications. Buttons, inputs and images aren't supported.

UTF-8 is the only supported text encoding. And yes, emojis are supported ;).

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that this whole thing is a hack. It may not work as expected or it
may surprise you by blowing up your program. You've been warned.

## Wrappers

* [osxnotify-python](https://github.com/tomekwojcik/osxnotify-python) - native Python wrapper,
* [osxnotify-python-cffi](https://github.com/tomekwojcik/osxnotify-python-cffi) - CFFI-based Python wrapper.
