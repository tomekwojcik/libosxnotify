Then\r\n[@lukaszkorecki](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki) suggested to support FFI\r\nso this code can be used in languages other than Python. The idea was to allow\r\nscripts to display notifications without relying on calling third party\r\nbinaries.\r\n\r\nIn time, the idea evolved to become a shared library which can be used by other\r\nprograms (e.g. the supplied `osxnotify` program) that want to display\r\nnotifications.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* OS X >= 10.9.4 - should work on Mountain Lion but it's not tested.\r\n* Xcode and command line utilities.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install the `libosxnotify` library, issue the following command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./configure\r\n$ make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the library will install to `/usr/local`. You can change this using\r\n`--prefix` parameter for `configure`, e.g. \r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./configure --prefix=/Users/bilbo/opt/libosxnotify\r\n$ make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSee the code of `osxnotify` program for usage example.\r\n\r\n## Issues and limitations\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of OS X notification system, it's currently impossible to\r\nchange the icon. OS X assumes that notifications are sent from a running app.\r\nSince this isn't the case in, say, Python scripts, libosxnotify has to hack\r\nObjective-C runtime to make it think there's an app running. By doing so,\r\nlibosxnotify sets the ID of the current up to the system-provided Terminal.app.\r\n\r\nlibosxnotify only supports text content (title, subtitle and informative text)\r\nin notifications. Buttons, inputs and images aren't supported.\r\n\r\nUTF-8 is the only supported text encoding. And yes, emojis are supported ;).\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this whole thing is a hack. It may not work as expected or it\r\nmay surprise you by blowing up your program. You've been warned.\r\n\r\n## Wrappers\r\n\r\n* [osxnotify-python](https://github.com/tomekwojcik/osxnotify-python) - native Python wrapper,\r\n* [osxnotify-python-cffi](https://github.com/tomekwojcik/osxnotify-python-cffi) - CFFI-based Python wrapper.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nlibosxnotify is licensed under MIT License.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\nlibosxnotify was written by [Tomek WÃ³jcik](http://www.tomekwojcik.com/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
